# DNA Methylation Datasets for Crassostrea gigas

## Major DNA Methylation Studies Identified

### 1. Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) Studies

#### Roberts Lab WGBS Studies
**Description**: Multiple WGBS studies from University of Washington Roberts Lab
**Estimated samples**: ~30-50 samples across studies
**Tissue types**: Gonad, gill, mantle, digestive gland
**Environmental conditions**: Temperature stress, pH stress, development
**Estimated file size**: ~200-400 GB total (WGBS generates large files)
**Notes**: Includes both Crassostrea gigas and likely some Magallana studies

#### Ocean Acidification Methylation Study
**Description**: DNA methylation response to ocean acidification
**Estimated samples**: ~20-30 samples
**Tissue types**: Gill, mantle
**Environmental conditions**: pH manipulation experiments
**Estimated file size**: ~150-250 GB total

### 2. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS)

#### Developmental Methylation Studies
**Description**: RRBS during oyster development and reproduction
**Estimated samples**: ~25-35 samples
**Tissue types**: Gonad, larvae, spat
**Environmental conditions**: Natural reproductive cycles, laboratory conditions
**Estimated file size**: ~50-100 GB total (RRBS smaller than WGBS)

#### Environmental Stress RRBS
**Description**: Methylation changes under environmental stress
**Estimated samples**: ~20-30 samples
**Tissue types**: Various adult tissues
**Environmental conditions**: Multiple stressors (temperature, salinity, hypoxia)
**Estimated file size**: ~40-80 GB total

### 3. MeDIP-seq Studies

#### Genome-wide Methylation Profiling
**Description**: MeDIP-seq for genome-wide methylation patterns
**Estimated samples**: ~15-25 samples
**Tissue types**: Adult tissues
**Environmental conditions**: Various experimental conditions
**Estimated file size**: ~30-60 GB total (MeDIP-seq smaller than bisulfite)

### 4. Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing

#### Gene-specific Methylation Studies
**Description**: Targeted analysis of specific gene regions
**Estimated samples**: ~20-40 samples
**Tissue types**: Multiple tissue types
**Environmental conditions**: Various experimental designs
**Estimated file size**: ~10-30 GB total (targeted approach)

## Magallana gigas Methylation Studies

### Recent Nomenclature Studies
**Description**: Studies using updated Magallana gigas nomenclature
**Estimated samples**: ~15-25 samples
**Tissue types**: Gonad, gill, mantle
**Environmental conditions**: Climate change studies
**Estimated file size**: ~100-200 GB total
