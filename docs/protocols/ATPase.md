## SEI Buffer Recipe

|     Reagent   |     Amount (g) |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|     Sucrose    |   42.79        |         
|      Na2EDTA   |       1.86     |
|      Imidazole |       1.7      |

1. Dissolve ingredients into 475ml diH20
2. Adjust pH to 7.3 and fill to 500ml
3. Good for 1 month at 4C


## ATPase Sample Collection Method

1. Place metal block and SEI buffer on ice. If no block, use a bucket of ice.
2. Fill 0.5ml tube(s) about halfway full of SEI buffer.
3. Place tissue into SEI buffer, about a 1:20 ratio of tissue to buffer is ideal. The tissue tends to get sticky if there is too much in the tube. Very little tissue is needed for this assay. 2-10 mg wet weight gill tissue from oyster worked fine. In salmon samples, a single gill filament was sufficient.
4. Top off tubes with SEI buffer (not necessary for ~20 mg tissue samples). Make sure that the tissue is completely submerged.
5. Keep as cold as possible until samples can be stored at -80C to minimize enzyme degredation.
