# Welcome to the Roberts Lab Handbook!

[Our](http://robertslab.info/) hope is this is a one-stop locale for relevant information. You can use navigation at the left, the search function, and a few quick pages of interest are highlighted below. If you see something needing updating, you should be able to click on the pencil on each page and go directly to the source to edit, or simply [submit an issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/new). Do not hesitate to [join the Discussion](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/discussions).
