#### Faculty

(Log in with UW net id)

In particular under "Policies"
1. "Salary recovery policy" explains how if you have too many grants
for your salary, you can use some to cover state salary, and then the
state salary gets shifted to SAFS (benefits portion) and your RCR (the
remainder).

2.  "Salary recovery policy" teaching buyout. You can buy out from 1
quarter of teaching a small seminar course, for 1.5 mo of salary, or a
large course for 2 mo of salary. Restrictions apply.

3. "Teaching release", when substantially revamping a course or
developing a new course, it is possible to get a one-quarter teaching
release.

In addition, there are University-wide policies that some of us have
signed up for:
1. A/B salary. For those who often have extra grant funding, it is
possible to use the A/B salary. Your state income stays the same, but
pays for only 80% or 90% of your time (basically an increase in
monthly salary rate), and the extra time is covered by external
grants. More details here:
https://environment.uw.edu/intranet/personnel/academic-human-resources/salary-compensation/ab-salary-retention-adjustment-policy

2. Personal mobile phone use for business. It is possible to cover a
portion of your cell phone bill from RCR if you use your cell phone
for UW business. More details here:
https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/APS/55.01.html
This one depends on departmental policy to some extent.
