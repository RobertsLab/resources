We have been using online lab notebooks since 2007 and the platforms and workflows have certainly changed over the years. Below is a compendium of best practices based on our experience and the particular research we do. This is intended for those in our lab group, however [comments and suggestions are welcome](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues).


An online lab notebook is required of all lab members. Entries need to be organized by date and in reverse chronological order, and **Updated daily**.

## Platforms

The current recommendation is Quarto in Rstudio. 

See [this page](https://sr320.github.io/course-fish521-2023/lectures/week_07/lec_06b_websites.html) for a tutorial on how to set up. 

## Make sure it is reproducible
Document in a fashion where someone could replicate your work.

## Document daily
A record of your work should be published the day of activity. Yep, daily! Even if you feel like you did nothing, post <em>something</em> to describe what you did that day. Did you read some papers? Great! Make a post that lists the papers you read. Did you spend all day searching the web? Also great! Make a post about what you were searching for and how successful you were in finding what you wanted.

## Maintain backup
Have a copy of your notebook in another location. This could be done in several ways.
- composing in text editor and hosting on GitHub
- using IFTTT to post/save entries elsewhere
- run script (i.e. wget) to archive contents

Periodically, you will be asked to show where your backup is and demonstrate that it is functional.

All GitHub-based notebooks are also backed up to Gannet: https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/github_backups/notebooks/
