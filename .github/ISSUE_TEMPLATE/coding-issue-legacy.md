**Note**: For most issues, please use the "Lab Support Request" template instead. This template is kept for specific coding troubleshooting.

### Please provide the following in your issue:

- [ ] Attempted code (can be script or a "one-liner")

  - Please paste any lines of code using back ticks (e.g. \`\`\`code goes in here\`\`\`\).
  

- [ ] Error message (if any)

- [ ] Desired output format (describe data if not a "standardized" format like FastA, BAM, SAM, etc.)

- [ ] Link(s) to input files/folders.



 ##### A GitHub repo is the preferred means of linking, particularly for R-related code issues.
