### 3. Coding Issue (Legacy)

## Template Design

These templates were created based on analysis of closed issues from the past year, which showed:
- 40-45% Server/Infrastructure issues
- 25-30% Bioinformatics tools problems  
- 15-20% R/RStudio configuration issues
- 10-15% Data management problems
- 8-10% Access management requests

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file:

3. **Check existing resources**: Reference the handbook and previous issues before submitting
4. **Use appropriate urgency channels**: For urgent issues, also post in Slack
